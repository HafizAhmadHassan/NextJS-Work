- Src usage because all the files should be in one directory
- Routing Information APP Directory vs Page Routing
- Import alias @ you can point to root directory

Installing devDependencies:
- typescript
- @types/node
- @types/react
- @types/react-dom
- postcss
- tailwindcss
- eslint
- eslint-config-next



- Nom run dev to check the default template

Lets Explore What it looks

- NextJS server side rendering and user can’t have its shipment
- Package.js you will see to have tailwind
- Tsconfig type script config nextjs already did for you
- Tailwind configuration we are going to do much configuration on this
- Postcss we need not to look
- Src have all the project files 

SRC
- We have two main things APP contains layout and page
- Global CSS contains tailwind things

Layout and Page
- Page serve content
- Navigation bar we put in layout 
- Inner folder have the same thing

Layout

- Meta Data of next contain title description
- Has fonts
- {children comes from page}

Page we remove
- Everything
- We placed h1 tag and chai air code text 2xl and text center 

Layout Type
- Readonly<{children : React.ReactNode}> this means we are defining  children parameter type as well which is react node and it can only be readonly
- If we for example try export default returnString(){ return “hello”} readonly protect this

Creating Chaipage
- Chai folder
- Inside folder we need to do only page className text 3xl text mt 8 means margin top

- Root Layout I am having Nav Item heading So everything will be having Nav Item

Chai Folder Layout

- Copy paste root layout
- Require React Foundation h2 Inner Layout Item

Creating Lemon inside Folder of Chai


So Layout and Routing willl be based on Folders
